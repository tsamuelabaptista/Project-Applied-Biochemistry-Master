# Use stoichiometric models to predict observed growth of Yarrowia lipolytica as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen
This repository contains the code and files of my Applied Biochemistry Master's Project entitled: "Use stoichiometric models to predict observed growth of Yarrowia lipolytica as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen".

In this Project, the iYli21 model (Yarrowia lipolyica W29 strain model) was used to predict the growth of Yarrowia lipolytica with leucine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The yeast-GEM model (consensus genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was used as a control for the iYli21 model, since it is known that Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not grow in the previous mentioned conditions, thus it is expected to obtain no growth under these conditions using the yeast-GEM model.
